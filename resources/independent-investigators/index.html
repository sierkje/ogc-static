    <h1>Municipal Resource: Independent Use of Force Investigators</h1>

    Independent Use of Force Investigators as a PDF</a></aside>
  <section id="intro">
    <p>The Oscar Grant Committee is pleased to present this list of independent investigators that
      are available to contract with municipal entities to perform investigations into use of
      force incidents ending in death or grave bodily injury.</p>
    <p>Our intent in providing this list is to be of service to two different parties. Firstly,
      the families and loved ones of persons injured or killed in use of force incidents in
      Northern California who seek the truth about what happened from an objective and qualified
      investigator without ties to the department and office involved in the incident.</p>
    <p>Secondly, we seek to serve municipalities to enable them to perform these much-needed
      independent investigations in a viable manner, especially if there is currently no law
      enforcement civilian oversight body in place in the municipality.</p>
    <p>A few additional pieces of information:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Neither our advocacy group nor any family/friends involved in a use of force incident
        has had any direct contact with any of the individuals on this list. In the preparation of
        this list, OGC asked only for the presentation of professional qualifications and
        availability for municipal contracts in this region.</li>
      <li>The investigators are presented in alphabetical order. We expect municipalities to
        interview, check references and engage in appropriate due diligence as with any other
        municipal contract. We hope that friend and family groups would also have a role in
        selecting the right individual because the independent investigator process should involve
        comfort on the part of all parties, both the municipality and loved ones impacted by a
        serious use of force incident.</li>
      <li>All of the individuals on the list are a part of the National Association for Civilian
        Oversight of Law Enforcement (NACOLE) community.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>The National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement elevates and advances
      high professional and ethical standards for and promotes the independence and authority of
      all entities charged with civilian oversight.</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Assists, supports, and educates jurisdictions considering or developing civilian
        oversight of law enforcement;</em></li>
      <li><em>Trains, educates, and sets high professional and ethical standards for organizations
        and practitioners charged with civilian oversight of law enforcement;</em></li>
      <li><em>Provides educational and informational resources relating to the field of civilian
        oversight of law enforcement;</em></li>
      <li><em>Supports efforts and strategies that afford civilian oversight organizations
        independence, adequate authority, and sufficient funding and staffing.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>While we understand that a list prepared by an advocacy group is likely to meet with some
      suspicion, we want to be clear that this effort is intended to assist and support
      individuals impacted by use of force incidents in a search for truth. As activists, we
      believe the record shows that law enforcement agencies are not best situated to investigate
      themselves and internal affairs processes often need and benefit from parallel independent
      efforts. We do not believe this should be threatening to law enforcement or municipalities,
      but should be welcomed as a check and balance and transparency measure.</p>

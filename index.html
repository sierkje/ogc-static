      <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 0;">Justice4Pedie is Justice4All</h2>
      <p>In January 2016, the Richmond City Council responded to a grassroots social justice movement by establishing a new police accountability policy desiigned to protect Richmond residents from unjust police violence by holding police accountable for such actions. The new procedure requires a special investigaion, independent of the Police and District Attorney, of any police killing or serious injury caused by police. If successful, this new policy could inspire other cities across America to follow its example as a measure to stop the epdemic of unjust police violence that plagues our nation.</p>
      <p>The first test of this landmark policy will be the case of Pedie Perez, a young man shot and killed by Richmond Police Officer Jensen on September 14, 2014, leading to widespread community concern over a possible cover-up.</p>
      <p>The social justice movement, the people of Richmond, and the whole nation are watching. Attend this public forum which will outline the facts of this case, the progress of the investigation, and the implications for the broader struggle for justice here in Richmond and across the nation.</p>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">We the undersigned see a
                  dire need for change.</span> The average American
                taxpayer understands that communities need good police
                officers and they are willing to compensate them with a
                great salary and benefits for their commitment to
                protect and serve. As law-abiding taxpayers and
                residents of those communities, we are no longer willing
                to tolerate our tax dollars being used to reward
                cowardly-incompetent police officers.</span><br>
              <div class="rte js-description-content"> <br>
                <span>An incompetent officer, is an officer equipped
                  with a bullet proof vest, pepper spray, a taser, a
                  baton, a radio to call for assistance, a canine
                  police-companion and training in hand-to-hand combat,
                  but favors using deadly force; knowing that the police
                  department will rally in support of their actions,
                  simply because they are members of the same union.</span><br>
                <br>
                <span>Since 1974, police officers have benefited
                  tremendously from having additional rights bestowed
                  upon them, through the passage of Joe Biden's Law
                  Enforcement Officer’s Bill of Rights. Yet, the
                  taxpayers have not gained any additional protection
                  under the law. As a result, each year there are
                  hundreds of officer involved homicides, which the
                  general public overwhelmingly believes were 100%
                  preventable.&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                <span>Despite having an understanding of basic criminal
                  laws and tactical training, the number of people
                  killed by the police, is a clear indication that there
                  is a need for legislation to protect citizens. We need
                  protection from officers who have undetected mental
                  illness, egos, unknown biases and the propensity to
                  kill although other options are available. There is no
                  test that can accurately detect those character traits
                  because no one can be certain of what’s in a person’s
                  heart.</span><br>
                <br>
                <span>As taxpayers, who are concerned about everyone’s
                  safety, it is time to reaffirm the value of human life
                  by putting our support behind a Value Human Life Bill.</span><br>
                <br>
                <span><em><strong>Value Human Life Bill</strong></em>&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                <span><span style="font-weight: bold;">First</span>,
                  police officers who kill or cause serious injury to an
                  unarmed civilian must be suspended without pay during
                  the investigation.&nbsp;Due to the nature of the job,
                  officers should be required to carry insurance that
                  will help their families financially if this were to
                  happen. A police officer's CalPERS Industrial
                  Disability Insurance will not be pre-funded by tax
                  dollars.&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                <span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second</span>,
                  police&nbsp;departments cannot investigate themselves.
                  The blue code of silence and cover-up is
                  blatant,&nbsp;and it's evident in the long list
                  of&nbsp;no conviction cases. There are too many cases
                  where charges&nbsp;are&nbsp;not filed by top
                  officials&nbsp;despite&nbsp;physical&nbsp;evidence
                  and&nbsp;eyewitness testimony,&nbsp;contradicting the
                  police department's statement of events.
                  The&nbsp;investigation process must include an
                  immediate&nbsp;toxicology exam.&nbsp;In addition,
                  unedited civilian video recordings must be considered
                  evidence.&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                <span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third</span>,
                  police officers who fire upon an unarmed or legally
                  armed civilian who is not in the act of committing a
                  felony offense will be fired, and charges brought
                  against that officer. They do not get to continue
                  their careers within law enforcement.&nbsp;Taxpayers
                  will not cover the cost of that officer's&nbsp;legal
                  defense.&nbsp;</span><br>
                <br>
                <span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fourth</span>,
                  the number of White, Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native
                  American police should be proportionate and reflective
                  of the members of that particular city. Officers
                  should be working in pairs, with those officers
                  identifying as two different races.</span><br>

District Attorney’s Office
900 Ward St, Martinez, CA 94553
Wed, Jan 18, 2017 at 12 Noon

Dear Friends,

It is time to act.  How much shameless corruption are we going to tolerate? As a community, we must fight back.

Contra Costa’s District Attorney Mark Peterson has violated the law. He has admitted to embezzlement, fraud, and perjury. He claims to be "humbled and embarrassed by his errors of judgment;" he says he will pay a fine for his "mistakes and errors."  Admission of guilt does not negate the fact that he broke the law and was caught red-handed only after an audit was conducted.

As the top law enforcement official, DA Mark Peterson is required to uphold and enforce the law but has failed miserably at his job. He lacks the ability to act in an ethical and lawful manner.  He has proven repeatedly that he has no integrity. For instance, he publicly blamed unarmed 24 year old Pedie Perez for causing his own murder and has contributed to the cover-up by not charging the officer despite overwhelming evidence that contradicts Officer Wallace Jensen’s LIES.  Eyewitnesses reported to the family and police that Pedie never tried to take the officer’s gun and even DNA supports their statements. DA Mark Peterson lacks the ability to analyze facts, and exercise impartial judgement based on the evidence provided.

Citizens are prosecuted for embezzlement, fraud and perjury. Why shouldn’t he be charged according to his crimes? We don’t get to pay fines and keep our $300K annual salary!!! When is he going to be prosecuted? When is his license to practice law going to be revoked?

A demonstration of concerned Contra Costa County residents and supporters is scheduled for Wednesday, January 18, at 12 noon to demand Mark Peterson's resignation. We will assemble at DA Mark Peterson's Office at 900 Ward St, Martinez.

Attorney Pamela Price will be speaking at the event. Ms. Price is the gutsy attorney who rescued the main witness in the police sex scandal after the Richmond Police Department sent her to Florida.

        <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Dear Colin Kaepernick, <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police Brutality and State
          Repression applaud you for taking a stand in an attempt to shine a
          light on what we feel is one of the greatest atrocities of our day,
          the unwarranted killing of black and brown people across this country
          by the repressive apparatus of the state, the police. <br>
          <br>
          It is a bold and courageous statement you are making. One that is sure
          to cost you professionally. However, regardless of the cost to you
          personally, you have chosen to throw in&nbsp; with the powerless and
          the oppressed to bring an end to this evil in order, to advocate for
          true justice and liberty for all, in short to truly live up to the
          ideals which our flag is supposed to represent. <br>
          <br>
          Be aware, Mr. Kaepernick, you are now in the cross hairs of those who
          are the enemies of social justice and like many of the progressive
          peoples' heroes of the past you will suffer retaliation. But true
          heroes have always been willing to pay that price. Your principled
          stand will inspire others to get off the sidelines and take the field
          of action and make some plays to advance social justice in this
          country. <br>
          <br>
          The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police Brutality And State&nbsp;
          Repression has been organizing and speaking out in behalf of the
          victims murdered by bad cops ever since we were formed in 2010 in
          response to the unjustified killing of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Oscar_Grant">Oscar








            Grant</a> by Johannes Mehserle, who was a BART Policeman at the
          time. We are not anti-police, we are pro-life, black and brown lives
          in particular. We are tired of seeing them cut short by the people who
          have sworn to protect them.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Reactionary elements in our society rail against the messengers of
          inconvenient truths, become outraged about perceived slights to our
          cherished symbols of authority, yet often remain far too silent about
          the injustices that makes it necessary to speak out in the first
          place.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police Brutality And State
          Repression will continue to speak out against police misconduct and
          stand with the families whose loved ones have been murdered by bad
          cops, and we will continue to stand with you Mr. Kaepernick. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police Brutality And State
          Repression extends the invitation to Colin Kaepernick to collaborate
          with us &amp; explore ways we can work together to advance the
          struggle. <br>

      <strong>RESOLVED:</strong> The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police
      Brutality and State Repression opposes and condemns the use of collective
      punishment by any police or military force. We consider such policies war
      crimes against the people of the world.<br>
      <br>
      We oppose and condemn any politician, Donald Trump or any other who
      advocates such a war crime as policy. We must fight them every step of the
      way.<br>
      <br>
      The Nazis routinely practiced collective punishment in their conquered
      territories, sometimes wiping out entire villages. NEVER AGAIN!

      <h2>Resolutions passed on April 5 2016</h2>
      <strong>RESOLVED: </strong>The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police
      Brutality and State Repression opposes and condemns Donald Trump's call
      for increased state repression of U.S. Government prisoners through the
      use of waterboarding and other even harsher methods of torture. The
      progressive movement must vigorously oppose these torture techniques as a
      dangerous move in the direction of a repressive police state.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>RESOLVED: </strong>The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police
      Brutality and State Repression recognizes and endorses Senator Bernie
      Sanders's call to investigate every police killing of an unarmed civilian
      and any death of a prisoner in police custody. We support building a mass

      <h2>SF Police Commission Meeting Following Mario Woods Shooting</h2>
    </div>
    <div>Gerald S., Stan W., and Steve J. of the Oscar Grant Committee went to
      the SF Police Commission meeting on 12/9/15 following the shooting of
      Mario woods and gave this report: <br>
      <br>
      [Gerald Smith:] <br>
      At 5 pm Wednesday nite there was a rally on the front step of SF City
      Hall. About 500 attended this rally and tried to get in the SF Police
      Commission meeting. Our forces, the working class opposition to police
      brutality, were not well organized, as per the related events that
      preceded this meeting (the Vigil 12/3/15 about 1,000 participants, the
      Town Hall Meeting 12/4/15 just under 1,000 participants) Because there
      were so many people the SF Police Commission bureaucrats had to set up an
      overflow room in which was a TV screen broadcasting the Police Commission
      meeting. <br>
      <br>
      [Stan Woods:] <br>
      The racial/ethnic composition was good with at least half of the crowd
      black, latino, and asian. Approx. half of the crowd was white. Also, many
      youth participated. <br>
      <br>
      [Steve Jacobsen:] <br>
      There was a crowd of protesters at SF City Hall, many speaking to the
      Police Commission. About 200-300 couldn't get into the hearing, but they
      stayed in the hallway doing mike-checks. Several young women led the crowd
      yelling chants for Police Chief Suhr and Mayor Ed Lee to resign. They were
      fired up. They fired up everybody in the building. It is the spark to
      create the fire that will result into another Ferguson. Also the people
      called for the six guilty officers to be indicted for this murderous
      crime. It felt like the beginning of the Sixties. <br>

      <h3>ACLU App Empowers People against Police Brutality</h3>
      The app is a tool to preserve documentation of police brutality.<br>
      <br>
      The Californian branch of the civil liberties group ACLU launched a free
      smart phone app on Thursday to guarantee they can document and preserve
      recorded instances of police brutality.<br>
      <br>
      The app allows ordinary people to both record and document encounters with
      state authorities from their cellphones while having it instantaneously
      transmitted to the ACLU’s servers. In light of past instances in which
      authorities have deliberately confiscated or destroyed such evidence, the
      app would guarantee the recordings’ preservation. It also allows people to
      send an alert to anyone in close range to the incident in order to
      potentially facilitate an organized community response. Get it <a href="//www.mobilejusticeca.org/">here</a>.

          <td>The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police Brutality &amp; State
            Repression (OGC) is a grassroots democratic organization that was
            formed as a conscious united front for justice against police
            brutality. The OGC is involved in the struggle for police
            accountability and is committed to stopping police brutality.<br>
            <br>
            In alliance with the International Longshore &amp; Warehouse Union
            (ILWU) we organized the October 23, 2010 labor and community rally
            for Justice for Oscar Grant. On that day the ILWU shut down the Bay
            Area ports in solidarity. Our mission is to educate, organize and
            mobilize people against police and state repression. Sisters and
            brothers! The Oscar Grant Committee invites you to join us in this
            vital struggle.<br>
            <br>
            We meet on the 1<sup>st</sup> Tuesday of each month at 7 pm at the
            Neibyl Proctor Library, 6501 Telegraph Avenue (near Alcatraz) in
            Oakland. For more information please call us at 925/798-3698 or <a href="mailto:oscargrantcommittee.ogc@gmail.com">e-mail us.</a><br>

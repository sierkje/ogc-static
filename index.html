    <h2 class="post__title">Oscar Grant Committee Letter to Richmond City
      Officials</h2>
    <p>August 14, 2017</p>
    <p>To: Richmond Mayor Tom Butt,<br>
      Members of the Richmond City Council,<br>
      Richmond Citizens Police Review Commission,<br>
      and City Attorney Bill Lindsay.</p>
    <p>We have learned that, when our members attended the monthly meeting of
      the Richmond Citizens Police Review Commission (RCPRC) on 8/2/2017, to
      hear the results of the City-mandated investigation into the murder of
      Richard &quot;Pedie&quot; Perez, they, and 3 others, were made to leave
      the building. They had to stand outside for approximately 45 minutes. They
      were told that it was during that time that the details of the
      investigation were discussed. We have reviewed the Brown Act and we do not
      see which section(s) justify telling members of the public to leave,
      especially when the purpose of the Brown Act was to prevent meetings of
      Boards and Commissions, behind closed doors. What is especially egregious
      is the fact that the unjustified killing of Pedie Perez was traumatic
      enough for his loved ones, without incidents like what happened at the
      RCPRC meeting, adding insult to injury.</p>
    <p>Please advise us as to where and what day/time the investigative report
      will be released to the public. Thank you very much. We hope to hear from
      you soon.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Gerald Smith, For The Oscar Grant Committee<br>
      Against Police Brutality and State Repression</p>
    <p>An Injury to One Is An Injury to All.<br>
      Without Struggle There Is No Justice.</p>

    <h2 class="post__title">Rally Held in Oakland To Free Mumia Abu-Jamal!</h2>
    <p>July 8th 2017 &mdash; A rally in Oakland demanded freedom for Mumia
      Abu-Jamal yesterday. A journalist, MOVE supporter, former Black Panther
      Party member and political prisoner, Mumia Abu-Jamal was framed in 1981
      for a crime he did not commit. His supporters have fought for his release
      since then, and this rally was held in solidarity with their call for
      actions world-wide on July 7th to <em>free Mumia now!</em></p>
    <p>The rally was built partly on the strength of Mumia's important victory
      against the prison system's years-long refusal to properly treat Mumia for
      his Hepatitis-C infection, in which Mumia came very close to death. Hep-C
      is a chronic condition faced by many prisoners in the US today.</p>
    <h3>Support From South African Workers For Mumia</h3>
    <p>Strong international support, including labor support, has come in for
      Mumia over many years. The following letter was sent in support of Mumia's
      struggle for proper and effective treatment for his Hep-C from NUMSA, the
      South African Metalworkers Union last year. NUMSA compared the treatment
      of US prisoners like Mumia today with that suffered by anti-apartheid
      fighters from the 1950s into the 1990s:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="quotation__body">&ldquo;The refusal of health care reminds us
        of the conditions we were put in (under) apartheid prisons where sick
        detainees were allowed to die in very deplorable lonely conditions in
        solitary as part of the punishment for their role in the
        struggle.&rdquo;</span>
      <span class="quotation__credit">Letter to PA Governor Wolf from So.
        African Metalworkers Union. 21 January 2016.</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Mumia has now been cured of his Hepatitis-C infection due to an
      international campaign and support from thousands of people like you, who
      refused to accept the official excuses, and demanded the full and
      effective anti-Hep-C treatment: &ldquo;No Execution By Medical
      Neglect!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>7,000 other Pennsylvania prisoners with Hep-C, and thousands more across
      the US, stand to benefit from the precedent set by this important victory.
      Mumia's win against his Hep-C infection--which he contracted in a
      transfusion after being shot and almost killed by police in 1981--depended
      on this kind of mass support. With a movement like this, we hope to go on
      to free Mumia!</p>
    <h3>Rally Demands Truth of Mumia's Frame-Up!</h3>
    <p>The rally in Oakland was held to demand: <em>Full Disclosure of
      Documents</em> relating to Mumia's innocence and frame-up! and <em>Free
      Mumia Now!</em> Flyers on this event, explaining the reasons for the rally
      and Mumia's case, were distributed to many receptive workers leaving work
      in downtown Oakland on Friday.</p>
    <p>The rally was led by former Black Panther and ex-longshore worker Gerald
      Sanders, and Ras Ceylan, a member of Chairman Fred Hampton Jr's POCC
      &quot;Panther Cubs&quot; (Prisoners Of Conscience Committee).</p>
    <p>The rally was called by the Labor Action Committee To Free Mumia
      Abu-Jamal, and participated in by Oakland Teachers For Mumia, The Oscar
      Grant Committee, Workers World Party, ANSWER Coalition, Party of Socialism
      and Liberation, Haiti Action, Bay Area United Against War, CODEPINK,
      Freedom Archives, Socialist Viewpoint, Socialist Action, the Mobilization
      To Free Mumia, the Freedom Socialist Party, the Peace and Freedom Party,
      the Partisan Defense Committee, Doro Chiba (the Japanese Railway Workers
      Union), and the Hoshino Defense Committee.</p>
    <h3>Speakers Demand Mumia's Freedom!</h3>
    <p>Most of these supporters had speakers at the rally, covering Mumia's case
      and other related issues: Jack Heyman (ILWU Local 10 retired) spoke for
      the Labor Action Committee; Oakland teacher Bob Mandel for Oakland
      Teachers for Mumia; Tova Fry, Workers World Party; and Richard Becker of
      ANSWER.</p>
    <p>Marsha Feinland spoke for for Peace and Freedom Party, and gave a clear
      denunciation of the capitalist two-party system. &ldquo;I'm glad this
      demonstration is not just about Trump,&rdquo; she said. She went on:
      &ldquo;Who was it who signed the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death
      Penalty Act?&rdquo; &ldquo;Clinton!&rdquo; roared back the crowd.
      &ldquo;And what is his party?&rdquo; &ldquo;Democrat&rdquo; said the
      crowd. &ldquo;And who was it who refused to pardon Mumia on his last day
      in office?&rdquo; &ldquo;Obama!&rdquo; &ldquo;And his party?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Democrat!&rdquo; &lsquo;Nuff said, and thanks to Marsha for this
      reminder.</p>
    <p>Ricardo Ortiz-Perez of the Frente Socialista de Puerto Rico reported on
      the recent victory of the liberation of Oscar L&oacute;pez Rivera, a
      Puerto Rican nationalist militant; Seto-San of the Hoshino Defense
      Committee and Doro-Chiba reported on Hoshino Fumiaki, a wrongly imprisoned
      anti-war activist in Japan; Gerald Sanders and Ras Ceylan spoke of the
      MOVE 9, framed for a crime they had nothing to do with; Pierre Labossiere
      of the Haiti Action Committee reported on the struggle against US
      imperialism and its puppet government in Haiti; Carole Seligman of the
      Kevin Cooper Defense Committee spoke for freedom for Kevin Cooper, a
      falsely convicted prisoner now on death row in San Quentin; and several
      speakers called for freedom for Leonard Peltier, the native American
      leader falsely accused and still imprisoned for the deaths of two FBI
      agents, a crime he didn't commit.</p>
    <p>Other supporters/speakers included: immigrant rights activist Cristina
      Gutierrez, who linked the struggle of black and brown workers to the
      struggle against US imperialism, and activist Alia Sharrief, who recited a
      spoken word poem of her creation.</p>
    <h3>Mumia Should Benefit From <em>Williams v. Pennsylvania</em></h3>
    <p>Mumia's case for freedom is many-fold: he is a journalist who exposed the
      corrupt and racist police regime of Frank Rizzo in Philadelphia for it's
      brutal crackdowns on the MOVE organization. As a result of that he was
      targeted by police and almost killed in 1981 at the scene of a shooting;
      and he was then framed by cops, prosecutors and politicians as the
      shooter. One of those prosecutors, Ronald Castille, later sat in judgement
      over Mumia's appeals against this frame-up as a member of the PA Supreme
      Court, despite defense demands that he should recuse himself!</p>
    <p>Now, a 2016 US Supreme Court ruling, <em>Williams v. Pennsylvania</em>,
      gives Mumia an opening: the Court says that a former prosecutor cannot
      later sit as a judge over the appeals of a case on which he was a
      prosecutor. Fairness, due procedure, unprejudiced judges, etc.: sounds
      obvious, doesn't it?</p>
    <p>Not so fast: the courts have often twisted or dropped their precedents in
      order to uphold the framing of political prisoners and victims of racist
      frame-ups such as Leonard and Mumia; and in this case, the Philadelphia
      district Attorney's office is trying to deny Mumia's defense the
      court-ordered discovery of notes, instructions and documents that will
      show exactly how former DA and prosecutor Ronald Castille involved himself
      in Mumia's case. We need to make this happen: that is why we need a mass
      movement to free Mumia.</p>
    <h3>Build a Mass Movement To Free Mumia!</h3>
    <p>At the rally Friday, we had about a hundred more or less, and that was
      what we could muster on short notice. But we need to work toward a mass
      turnout to free Mumia. In 1995, thousands turned out to stop a death
      warrant issued against Mumia just before his appeal hearing of that year;
      and in 1999 the longshore workers of the ILWU shut down all the ports on
      the West Coast to free Mumia, and many of them (ILWU Local 10) came out to
      lead the march in SF to free Mumia on his birthday, April 24th. Also that
      same year, Oakland teachers mobilized to hold unauthorized teach-ins in
      the Oakland public schools on Mumia and the death penalty.</p>
    <p>The Labor Action Committee To Free Mumia Abu-Jamal calls for your help:
      let's build this important movement. Please respond to this email with any
      comments and/or offers of support.</p>
    <p><em>Comply with the judge's order! Release all documents pertaining to
      Mumia's frame-up! Free Mumia and all victims of racist frame-ups! Build
      mass and workers' actions to free Mumia!</em></p>

      finally free him!</p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="quotation__body">&ldquo;...I'm Hep C 'negative'! Aint't that a gas? I wanna thank you and the brothers in N. Cali for helping to make it happen. Without a people's movement we would have never gotten into ct. W/out it, we never coulda won...&rdquo;</span>
      <span class="quotation__credit">Excerpt from Mumia's letter to the Labor Action Committee To Free Mumia Abu-Jamal.</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Mumia's Hepatitis-C infection, which came from a blood transfusion in the
      hospital after he was critically wounded from police shooting him on
      December 9, 1981, is cured due to active support by thousands of
      supporters who tirelessly resisted the PA prison system's refusal to
      supply the needed medication. Mumia's federal legal victory is now the
      precedent to provide Hep-C treatment to thousands of prisoners.</p>
    <h3>Mumia's New Legal Action</h3>
    <p>Now, Mumia has a new legal action pending in the Pennsylvania courts, and
      the movement of Mumia's supporters worldwide has called for actions to
      free Mumia on July 7th.</p>
    <p>Mumia's legal action is based on the 2016 US Supreme Court ruling in the
      case of Williams v Pennsylvania. The Supreme Court ruled that a prosecutor
      who &ldquo;had significant personal involvement&rdquo; in a &ldquo;critical
      decision&rdquo; cannot later sit in judgment in appeals concerning the
      very same case. This was found to be a conflict of interest, which
      violates the due process right to an impartial appeal. In the Williams
      case, the former DA, then judge, was one Ronald Castille. The U.S. Supreme
      Court ruled Williams now has the right to re-litigate all of his legal
      arguments that were previously rejected.</p>
    <p>In Mumia's case, the very same Ronald Castille was the Philadelphia
      District Attorney who argued to uphold Mumia's frame-up conviction and
      death sentence in 1989 and then as a Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice
      denied all Mumia's post-conviction appeals from 1998-2008. Last August
      Mumia filed a post-conviction appeal based on the Williams decision. A
      legal victory in Mumia's action will reinstate his appeal rights to assert
      his innocence and the wholesale denial of his due process trial
      rights.</p>
    <h3>Mumia Won &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; But DA's Office Stonewalls</h3>
    <p>On April 28, 2017 Mumia Abu-Jamal won in court against the prosecution
      motion to dismiss Mumia's new appeal. The judge also ordered the District
      Attorney's Office to disclose all files and information that would support
      Mumia's claims that his state appeal process was corrupted because
      Philadelphia District Attorney Ronald Castille was involved in prosecuting
      Mumia's appeals. Not surprisingly, the DA's office did not comply. Only
      public documents from Mumia's case that have Castille's name listed as
      District Attorney were released. Mumia's lawyers have demanded &ldquo;full
      compliance&rdquo; with the judge's order and the judge issued a new order
      to the DA to release the files by July 7.</p>
    <p>The DA's office states there is no evidence of Castille's involvement in
      Mumia's case. This is a cover-up of the prosecutorial, police and judicial
      frame-up of Mumia. It is inconceivable that Castille as District Attorney
      did not make &ldquo;critical decisions&rdquo; on Mumia's appeal given that
      he was elected to that office as a &ldquo;law-and-order&rdquo; and
      pro-death penalty candidate. When he ran for Supreme Court justice he
      openly bragged that he put 45 men on death row. Castille also stated
      publicly that he was personally responsible for all filings in the U.S.
      Supreme Court.</p>
    <h3>Mumia Challenges Race Discrimination and Lies in Prosecution</h3>
    <p>Mumia's appeals included direct challenges to the practice of racial
      discrimination in jury selection, as well as prosecution's arguments that
      told jury's they could ignore the responsibility for sentencing someone to
      death, since a defendant had &ldquo;appeal after appeal.&rdquo; Mumia also
      challenged the prosecution using his teenaged membership in the Black
      Panther Party to argue that Mumia had a life-long intent to kill a police
      officer. These issues were fought in the PA Supreme Court and then in the
      U.S. Supreme Court by Mumia while Castille was the District Attorney.</p>
    <p>As DA, Castille produced a training videotape to instruct prosecutors how
      to evade the 1986 Batson decision, a US v Supreme Court ruling which
      banned racial discrimination in jury selection. Prosecutors were told how
      to keep Black people off their juries and how to conceal this
      discriminatory purpose.</p>
    <p>During Mumia's 1988 appeals to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and then to
      the U.S. Supreme Court, the D.A.'s office argued that Mumia could not
      prove the prosecution's discriminatory motive when they removed Black
      people from his jury. The existence of the videotape, which was the very
      evidence of the discriminatory motive, was suppressed.</p>
    <h3>Former Prosecutor Sits In Judgement On Mumia's Case</h3>
    <p>As a PA Supreme Court Judge, Castille sat in judgment over all the
      appeals of Mumia's case since 1998, including the issues of his direct
      appeal&mdash;jury selection (Batson), jury integrity (appeal after
      appeal), membership in the Black Panther Party, as well as the new
      evidence of coercion of witnesses, of falsified ballistics, the confession
      of Arnold Beverly, who confessed to being the actual killer, and the
      racial bias of the trial and post-conviction hearing judge Albert Sabo,
      who stated, &ldquo;I'm gonna help 'em fry the n----r&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>In 1996 and again in 2002 Mumia's lawyers demanded that Castille recuse
      himself from hearing the case, on account of his earlier role as
      prosecutor over the same case. In each instance, Castille refused to
      recuse himself, stating he had no knowledge of Mumia's case. Castille
      denied any knowledge of the DA/TV videotape.</p>
    <p>Yet Castille's alleged &ldquo;non-involvement&rdquo; is what the current
      Philadelphia DA now wants us to believe, as their office has refused the
      full &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; of evidence of Castille's collusion (in
      framing Mumia), which was ordered by the Philadelphia Court earlier this
      year! This is why we call for action now.</p>
    <h3>Demand Full Disclosure of Documents in Mumia's Case!</h3>
    <p>We need to free Mumia now, and demand full disclosure of documents in his
      case! The Williams decision could lead to the throwing out of all the
      negative decisions on Mumia's appeals by the PA Supreme Court, which, in
      turn, could lead to throwing out his original false conviction! But all of
      Mumia's scant victories in court, such as the reversal of his original
      death sentence, have depended on the mass mobilization of his supporters
      worldwide.</p>
    <p>Mumia Abu-Jamal is a journalist, a former Black Panther, a MOVE supporter
      and an innocent political prisoner. His freedom from false murder charges
      is long overdue, after 36 years for a crime he did not commit. Winning
      Mumia's freedom is a fight against this injustice system and paves the way
      for others, as did his victory to get Hep-C treatment, which is precedent
      for Pennsylvania prisoners as well as other thousands nationwide.</p>
    <p>Former political prisoners such as Panther Albert Woodfox, whistle-blower
      Chelsea Manning, and Puerto Rican Nationalist/activist Oscar Lopez Rivera
      have recently achieved freedom with the help and support of masses of
      supporters. Now, let us move on.</p>
    <p>In 1995 we mobilized in the thousands against the death warrant issued by
      the Pennsylvania governor; and in 1999 Longshore workers on the entire
      West Coast of the US shut down all ports to free Mumia. Also in 1999,
      Oakland teachers held unauthorized teach-ins in Oakland Schools on Mumia
      and the death penalty.</p>
    <p><strong>Join us at Oscar Grant Plaza, 14th &amp; Broadway, Oakland, on
      Friday July 7th, at 4pm. Rally and march to the Federal Building, with
      flyers to distribute on Mumia's case. Solidarity with Mumia and all his

      Policy Faces First Test</strong></p>
    <h2 class="post__title no-margin-top">Justice4Pedie is Justice4All</h2>
    <p>In January 2016, the Richmond City Council responded to a grassroots
      social justice movement by establishing a new police accountability policy
      desiigned to protect Richmond residents from unjust police violence by
      holding police accountable for such actions. The new procedure requires a
      special investigaion, independent of the Police and District Attorney, of
      any police killing or serious injury caused by police. If successful, this
      new policy could inspire other cities across America to follow its example
      as a measure to stop the epdemic of unjust police violence that plagues
      our nation.</p>
    <p>The first test of this landmark policy will be the case of Pedie Perez, a
      young man shot and killed by Richmond Police Officer Jensen on September
      14, 2014, leading to widespread community concern over a possible
      cover-up.</p>
    <p>The social justice movement, the people of Richmond, and the whole nation
      are watching. Attend this public forum which will outline the facts of
      this case, the progress of the investigation, and the implications for the
      broader struggle for justice here in Richmond and across the nation.</p>

      href="//www.change.org/u/15446422">Proposed Initiative Measure for a
      'Value Human Life' Bill</a></em></h2>
    <p><strong>We the undersigned see a dire need for change.</strong> The
      average American taxpayer understands that communities need good police
      officers and they are willing to compensate them with a great salary and
      benefits for their commitment to protect and serve. As law-abiding
      taxpayers and residents of those communities, we are no longer willing to
      tolerate our tax dollars being used to reward cowardly-incompetent police
      officers.</p>
    <p>An incompetent officer, is an officer equipped with a bullet proof vest,
      pepper spray, a taser, a baton, a radio to call for assistance, a canine
      police-companion and training in hand-to-hand combat, but favors using
      deadly force; knowing that the police department will rally in support of
      their actions, simply because they are members of the same union.</p>
    <p>Since 1974, police officers have benefited tremendously from having
      additional rights bestowed upon them, through the passage of Joe Biden's
      Law Enforcement Officer's Bill of Rights. Yet, the taxpayers have not
      gained any additional protection under the law. As a result, each year
      there are hundreds of officer involved homicides, which the general public
      overwhelmingly believes were 100% preventable.</p>
    <p>Despite having an understanding of basic criminal laws and tactical
      training, the number of people killed by the police, is a clear indication
      that there is a need for legislation to protect citizens. We need
      protection from officers who have undetected mental illness, egos, unknown
      biases and the propensity to kill although other options are available.
      There is no test that can accurately detect those character traits because
      no one can be certain of what's in a person'sheart.</p>
    <p>As taxpayers, who are concerned about everyone's safety, it is time to
      reaffirm the value of human life by putting our support behind a Value
      Human Life Bill.</p>
    <h3><em>Value Human Life Bill</em></h3>
    <p class="float float--right"><a
      href="/static/oscargrantcommittee.org_files/Value-Human-Life-Bill2.pdf"><img
      src="/static/oscargrantcommittee.org_files/Value-Human-Life-Bill2.jpg"
      title="Something has to change" alt="Click for PDF" width="480"
      height="608" border="0" class="float__img"></a></p>
    <p><strong>First</strong>, police officers who kill or cause serious injury
      to an unarmed civilian must be suspended without pay during the
      investigation. Due to the nature of the job, officers should be required
      to carry insurance that will help their families financially if this were
      to happen. A police officer's CalPERS Industrial Disability Insurance will
      not be pre-funded by tax dollars.</p>
    <p><strong>Second</strong>, police departments cannot investigate
      themselves. The blue code of silence and cover-up is blatant, and it's
      evident in the long list of no conviction cases. There are too many cases
      where charges are not filed by top officials despite physical evidence and
      eyewitness testimony, contradicting the police department's statement of
      events. The investigation process must include an immediate toxicology
      exam. In addition, unedited civilian video recordings must be considered
      evidence.</p>
    <p><strong>Third</strong>, police officers who fire upon an unarmed or
      legally armed civilian who is not in the act of committing a felony
      offense will be fired, and charges brought against that officer. They do
      not get to continue their careers within law enforcement. Taxpayers will
      not cover the cost of that officer's legal defense.</p>
    <p><strong>Fourth</strong>, the number of White, Black, Hispanic, Asian and
      Native American police should be proportionate and reflective of the
      members of that particular city. Officers should be working in pairs, with
      those officers identifying as two different races.</p>

      900 Ward St, Martinez, CA 94553</p>
    <p>Wed, Jan 18, 2017 at 12 Noon</p>
    <p>Dear Friends,</p>
    <p>It is time to act. How much shameless corruption are we going to
      tolerate? As a community, we must fight back.</p>
    <p>Contra Costas District Attorney Mark Peterson has violated the law. He
      has admitted to embezzlement, fraud, and perjury. He claims to be &quot;humbled
      and embarrassed&quot; by his errors of judgment;&quot; he says he will pay
      a fine for his &quot;mistakes and errors.&quot; Admission of guilt does
      not negate the fact that he broke the law and was caught red-handed only
      after an audit was conducted.</p>
    <p>As the top law enforcement official, DA Mark Peterson is required to
      uphold and enforce the law but has failed miserably at his job. He lacks
      the ability to act in an ethical and lawful manner. He has proven
      repeatedly that he has no integrity. For instance, he publicly blamed
      unarmed 24 year old Pedie Perez for causing his own murder and has
      contributed to the cover-up by not charging the officer despite
      overwhelming evidence that contradicts Officer Wallace Jensen's LIES.
      Eyewitnesses reported to the family and police that Pedie never tried to
      take the officer's gun and even DNA supports their statements. DA Mark
      Peterson lacks the ability to analyze facts, and exercise impartial
      judgement based on the evidence provided.</p>
    <p>Citizens are prosecuted for embezzlement, fraud and perjury. Why
      shouldn't he be charged according to his crimes? We don't get to pay fines
      and keep our $300K annual salary!!! When is he going to be prosecuted?
      When is his license to practice law going to be revoked?</p>
    <p>A demonstration of concerned Contra Costa County residents and supporters
      is scheduled for Wednesday, January 18, at 12 noon to demand Mark
      Peterson's resignation. We will assemble at DA Mark Peterson's Office at
      900 Ward St, Martinez.</p>
    <p>Attorney Pamela Price will be speaking at the event. Ms. Price is the
      gutsy attorney who rescued the main witness in the police sex scandal
      after the Richmond Police Department sent her to Florida.</p>

    <p>The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police Brutality and State Repression
      applaud you for taking a stand in an attempt to shine a light on what we
      feel is one of the greatest atrocities of our day, the unwarranted killing
      of black and brown people across this country by the repressive apparatus
      of the state, the police.</p>
    <p>It is a bold and courageous statement you are making. One that is sure to
      cost you professionally. However, regardless of the cost to you
      personally, you have chosen to throw in with the powerless and the
      oppressed to bring an end to this evil in order, to advocate for true
      justice and liberty for all, in short to truly live up to the ideals which
      our flag is supposed to represent.</p>
    <p>Be aware, Mr. Kaepernick, you are now in the cross hairs of those who are
      the enemies of social justice and like many of the progressive peoples'
      heroes of the past you will suffer retaliation. But true heroes have
      always been willing to pay that price. Your principled stand will inspire
      others to get off the sidelines and take the field of action and make some
      plays to advance social justice in this country.</p>
    <p>The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police Brutality And State Repression
      has been organizing and speaking out in behalf of the victims murdered by
      bad cops ever since we were formed in 2010 in response to the unjustified
      killing of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Oscar_Grant">Oscar
        Grant</a> by Johannes Mehserle, who was a BART Policeman at the time. We
      are not anti-police, we are pro-life, black and brown lives in particular.
      We are tired of seeing them cut short by the people who have sworn to
      protect them.</p>
    <p>Reactionary elements in our society rail against the messengers of
      inconvenient truths, become outraged about perceived slights to our
      cherished symbols of authority, yet often remain far too silent about the
      injustices that makes it necessary to speak out in the first place.</p>
    <p>The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police Brutality And State Repression
      will continue to speak out against police misconduct and stand with the
      families whose loved ones have been murdered by bad cops, and we will
      continue to stand with you Mr. Kaepernick.</p>
    <p>The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police Brutality And State Repression
      extends the invitation to Colin Kaepernick to collaborate with us &amp;
      explore ways we can work together to advance the struggle.</p>

      use of waterboarding and other even harsher methods of torture. The
      progressive movement must vigorously oppose these torture techniques as a
      dangerous move in the direction of a repressive police state.</p>
    <p><strong>RESOLVED:</strong> The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police
      Brutality and State Repression recognizes and endorses Senator Bernie
      Sanders's call to investigate every police killing of an unarmed civilian
      and any death of a prisoner in police custody. We support building a mass
      movement to implement these demands.</p>

    <h2 class="post__title">SF Police Commission Meeting Following Mario Woods
      Shooting</h2>
    <p>Gerald S., Stan W., and Steve J. of the Oscar Grant Committee went to the
      SF Police Commission meeting on 12/9/15 following the shooting of Mario
      Woods and gave this report:</p>
    <p>[Gerald Smith:] <br>
      At 5 pm Wednesday nite there was a rally on the front step of SF City
      Hall. About 500 attended this rally and tried to get in the SF Police
      Commission meeting. Our forces, the working class opposition to police
      brutality, were not well organized, as per the related events that
      preceded this meeting (the Vigil 12/3/15 about 1,000 participants, the
      Town Hall Meeting 12/4/15 just under 1,000 participants) Because there
      were so many people the SF Police Commission bureaucrats had to set up an
      overflow room in which was a TV screen broadcasting the Police Commission
      meeting.</p>
    <p>[Stan Woods:] <br>
      The racial/ethnic composition was good with at least half of the crowd
      black, latino, and asian. Approx. half of the crowd was white. Also, many
      youth participated.</p>
    <p>[Steve Jacobsen:] <br>
      There was a crowd of protesters at SF City Hall, many speaking to the
      Police Commission. About 200-300 couldn't get into the hearing, but they
      stayed in the hallway doing mike-checks. Several young women led the crowd
      yelling chants for Police Chief Suhr and Mayor Ed Lee to resign. They were
      fired up. They fired up everybody in the building. It is the spark to
      create the fire that will result into another Ferguson. Also the people
      called for the six guilty officers to be indicted for this murderous
      crime. It felt like the beginning of the Sixties.</p>

      Brutality</h2>
    <p>The app is a tool to preserve documentation of police brutality.</p>
    <p>The Californian branch of the civil liberties group ACLU launched a free
      smart phone app on Thursday to guarantee they can document and preserve
      recorded instances of police brutality.</p>
    <p>The app allows ordinary people to both record and document encounters
      with state authorities from their cellphones while having it
      instantaneously transmitted to the ACLU's servers. In light of past
      instances in which authorities have deliberately confiscated or destroyed
      such evidence, the app would guarantee the recordings' preservation. It
      also allows people to send an alert to anyone in close range to the
      incident in order to potentially facilitate an organized community
      response. <a href="//www.mobilejusticeca.org/">Get the ACLU App</a>.</p>

    <h2>About The Oscar Grant Committee (OGC)</h2>
    <p>The Oscar Grant Committee Against Police Brutality &amp; State Repression

      solidarity. Our mission is to educate, organize and mobilize people
      against police and state repression. Sisters and brothers! The Oscar Grant

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Just after midnight on Saturday
May 6th, Alan Blueford and two of his
friends were waiting for some girls to pick them up on 90th Ave., in
East Oakland, after the Floyd Mayweather fight. Not long after Alan had
phoned his parents to check-in with them, a car slowly pulled up to
them with its lights off. Alan ran. One officer gave chase. A few
blocks later Alan was shot by OPD officer Miguel Masso. Masso also shot
himself in the foot. Over a dozen witnesses all said that Alan had no
weapon and posed no threat to the officer.<br>

The Blueford family and the Justice 4 Alan Blueford Coalition are

Alan’s murder.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OPD Chief Howard Jordan be held accountable for
lying to the Blueford family.<br>

            <td style="vertical-align: top;">On Saturday, Jan.
22, 2010 20-year-old Raheim Malik Brown was shot and killed by the
Oakland Unified School District’s police force near a Skyline High
School dance. Police statements and media have reported that Brown
tried to stab an officer with a screwdriver, and a second officer shot
Brown five times – once in each arm, once in his chest and twice in his
head – in defense of his partner.<br>
            <br>
On Thursday, Feb. 3, outside the OUSD headquarters, Brown’s mother,
Lori Davis, spoke at a press conference. Calling the killing an
“assassination,” she was horrified by the excessive use of force by
school police officers. Davis believes that Sgts. Barhim Bhatt and
Jonathan Bellusa, the two cops identified at<br>

the press conference as the two involved in Brown’s killing, should
“never be able to work in another police department ever.”<br>
      <br>
Tamisha Stewart, the only civilian witness to the killing, who was in
the car with Brown outside the Skyline High dance, spoke for the first
time publicly about the event. The screwdriver Brown was accused of
using as a weapon, according to Stewart, was being used in an attempt
to hotwire the car, and it “never left the ignition.”<br>
      <br>
While hotwiring a car might be cause for police attention, it is not
cause for five bullets, including two to the head. Stewart added,
“There was nothing that Raheim did that he deserved to die.” According
to statements at the press conference, after Brown was killed, Stewart
was beaten badly and jailed for almost a week.<br>
      <br>
An Oakland teacher’s union representative also spoke at the Thursday
press conference, saying that the union had voted to “support fully an
independent investigation” into Brown’s killing and the OUSD Police
Department.<br>
      <br>
Brown was one of three people killed by police in a single week in
Oakland. In early 2010 former Oakland Police Chief Anthony Batts called
on the FBI for an external investigation into the November police
killing of Derrick Jones. As initial police statements contrast sharply
with Stewart’s account of Brown’s killing, further investigation into
this case might also be warranted.<br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">On the morning of July 22, 2010
at around 11:30, 16 year old James Rivera was assassinated in
premeditated murder, according to his family and witnesses.
According to James Rivera's mother police came to her house late at
night/early morning before the murder and terrorized the family. Police
held guns at 2 even younger children and told them they were going to
kill him. </td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Later, according to friends, he
was pulled over then released and then chased. As he crashed into a
fence and made a u turn , police rammed the back of the blue van which
caused the van to go out of control. The van went onto a lawn of a
corner house on Salters Dr and Bancroft Way, finally crashed straight
into the garage wall where the van seemed to be lodged into.<br>
      <br>
Officers exited their vehicles and asked James to exit the van twice
but 2 seconds later they began to shoot. Over 30 rounds have been
estimated to be found. They executed those rounds with 9mm handguns and
fully automatic M-16 assault riffles.<br>
      <br>
Witnesses say that the ambulance arrived with out their sirens and left
without them, as if there was no urgency. The people believe that he
was dead at the scene. They saw officers pull him out and slap his face
and then do nothing.<br>
      <br>
Reporters are saying that police stated the pursuit began at 10:30
after finding the van that had been part of a carjacking with a
shotgun. It has not been said if this was the van, and the police do
not mention any previous encounters with James Rivera. The media has
yet to report the truth, i know we heard the people speak the truth and
that's not what they are printing.<br>
      <br>
People came out in rage of what they had just witnessed. "NO JUSTICE NO
PEACE" the people chanted until the officials Chaplin later came to
them and asked them to be quiet.<br>
      <br>
in the Stockton Record Stockton Police Spokesperson Pete Smith agreed
that the crowd was "upset and very vocal about their concerns" but was
also recorded threatening the community "Let officers complete their
investigation and not unduly create any other situations that would
need any kind of police investigation"<br>
      <br>
Although the people continued to chant after the Chaplin told a couple
that it would do them no good, people realized the importance of
speaking up for injustices like this one.<br>
      <br>
The Stockton police officers involved in the shooting were Officer Eric
Azarvand, a 14-year department veteran; Officer Gregory Dunn, with the
department eight years; and San Joaquin County sheriff's deputy John
Thomas Nesbitt, with 11 years at the sheriff's department.<br>

On January 6, 2012 Mothers Cry for Justice, James Rivera family, Ernest
Duenez family, Oscar Grant Committee, Modesto Copwatch , MDS /SDS
[Movement &amp; Students for a Democratic Society] &amp; Nation of
Islam united to sponsor a spirited and loud protest action in downtown
Stockton demanding answers from the DA who has remained silent about
the police killing of unarmed youth &amp; adults.&nbsp; Ms. Dionne
Smith-Downs, James Rivera's mother gave an impassioned and powerful
speech demanding jail for the cop murderers and justice for
James.&nbsp; It was militant action with no arrests even though the
police mobilized and pushed back the rally for a few minutes before
leaving.<br>

were both involved in a previous shooting
incident on July 19, 2008 that resulted in the death of Leslie Allen,
according to records from the Oakland Police Department and the Alameda
County District Attorney.<br>
      <br>
The Jones shooting is being investigated by the Alameda County District
Attorney’s office, as well as the Homicide and Internal Affairs
sections of OPD. District Attorney’s reviews often take several months
to complete, and have been known to stretch on for years.&nbsp; Former
Chief of Police Batts asked the FBI to investigate the shooting.<br>
      <br>
Perez-Angeles is the fourth current member of OPD’s SWAT team to be
involved in an officer-involved shooting since 2003, according to OPD
records. Both he and Daza-Quiroz remained on paid administrative leave,
which is standard practice after an officer-involved shooting.<br>

From the February 2011 Alameda County DA’s report on the shooting of
Derrick Jones:&nbsp; “There is a lack of evidence to support a
prosecution against eitherofficer. This office will take no further

the family calls, they are ignored or told there is nothing new. They
have not posted a description of the assailants or a reward for their

On January 16, 2012 the Oscar Grant Committee, and Kerry Junior's
family gathered to honor his memory and demand answers from the Oakland
Police Department, the Citizens Police Review Board, and the Internal
Affairs Division of the Oakland Police Department. The Community joined

Street Violence. We want solutions to the needless killing of our
children.<br>

“Kerry’s Murder has left a void in our family that can never be filled.
We will not see him marry, have children, graduate from College, or
smile ever again. Those who murdered him do not understand the pain his
family is going through,” said his Grandmother Anita Wills who is a
member of the Oscar Grant Committee.<br>

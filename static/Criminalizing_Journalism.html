    </strike>Recently we have observed a disturbing increase in the
    criminalization of <span class="il">journalists</span> and
    activists covering the events at the Dakota Access Pipeline and
    elsewhere. If you haven’t read about it yet, here is what has gone
    down so far:<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    • On September 3<sup>rd</sup>, Amy Goodman from <i><span class="il">Democracy</span>
      <span class="il">Now</span>!</i> was on location at the DAPL
    construction site when private security forces instigated a violent
    confrontation with peaceful water protectors. She was not involved
    in the confrontation and she was not arrested, but for simply <i>being

      present </i>and <i>reporting </i>on the incident she was
    charged with misdemeanor rioting, which would have landed her a year
    in prison. Yesterday the presiding judge dropped the charges.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    • Actress Shailene Woodley, who had been camping at Standing Rock
    and reporting what she saw over social media (her Twitter account
    alone has 1.2 million followers), was arrested on October 10th while
    walking back to her RV after attending a prayer action. She is being
    charged with criminal trespassing, which carries a $3,000 fine and
    60 days in jail, if sentenced.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    • Award-winning documentary filmmaker Deia Schlosberg was
    documenting a direct action at a section of TransCanada’s Keystone
    Pipeline in Walhalla, ND, where activists turned off the pipes using
    the emergency shut-off valves. This was part of a multi-state
    protest at other oil pipelines in Minnesota and Washington, in
    solidarity with the people at Standing Rock. Though she did not
    participate in the action, she was arrested and is being charged
    with 3 felony counts: “conspiracy to theft of property,” “conspiracy
    to theft of services,” and “conspiracy to tampering with or damaging
    a public service.” If convicted, the cumulative prison time for
    these sentences would be 45 years (more than Edward Snowden faces
    for whistleblowing on the NSA!). There is a petition to drop all
    charges here: <a

    &nbsp;<br>
    • 4 <span class="il">journalists</span> from the alternative media
    outlet <i>Unicorn Riot</i> have been arrested since last month
    while covering various direct actions. All four were strip-searched
    unnecessarily after their arrest, and they are being charged with
    criminal trespassing. There are more details about their arrests
    here: <a

    &nbsp;<br>
    These are only the high-profile cases, and these are only pertaining
    to the DAPL. There are many more lesser-known activists, <span
      class="il">journalists</span>, and filmmakers in other social
    movements being intimidated and arrested, their equipment and
    footage confiscated, and they sit in jail cells waiting for
    ridiculously trumped up charges to be fabricated and used against
    them.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    This extreme reaction from the authorities is highly unethical and
    dangerous. That’s not really a surprising comment given the track
    record of governments everywhere, but we must continue to assert our
    right as <span class="il">journalists</span>, documentarians, and
    media-makers to report on current events without retribution.<br>
    <br>
    One of our members traveled to Standing Rock just last month to
    document this incredibly brave movement and produced <a

      short piece</a>, which we screened at our most recent film night.
    We're glad he didn't have any trouble, and happy to support this
    kind of film work in any way we can.<br>
    <br>
    We hope it has been useful to you to have all this information
    synthesized in one place, and we hope everyone will continue to
    follow the situation closely and show their support.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks for reading!<br>

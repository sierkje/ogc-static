    <h3>The Demouria Hogg case</h3>
    <div>
      On June 6, 2015 Oakland Police Officer Nicole Rhodes shot Demouria Hogg to death.
      Hogg had been unconscious behind the wheel of a BMW that, according to San Francisco
      police, had been involved in a robbery and a chase there the night before.
      Firefighters had reported seeing a firearm in the passenger's seat, and police
      tried for an hour to rouse Hogg with loudspeakers, beanbag rounds, and by breaking the
      car's windows. Finally they sent one officer in to grab the gun while Officer Rhodes
      provided covering fire through the windshield. Although she said she couldn't see Hogg
      clearly, she also said that she saw him reach over to the passenger's seat where the
      gun was still sitting. Rhodes fired two shots at Hogg, killing him (another officer
      fired a taser at about the same time).<br/><br/>
      The Community Response Team of the Anti Police-Terror Project interviewed 15 witnesses
      to the police action; read or watched media reports; listened to publicly-posted
      recordings of police, sheriff's, and fire department radio chatter during the
      operation; analyzed bystanders' photos and video of the scene; and discussed the case
      with an officer from another jurisdiction.

      <h3>Propaganda War in Baltimore: Some Commercial Media Waking Up!</h3>
      People of color and veteran activists know that murders and cover-ups by
      police are nothing new. What's new is the recording equipment that enables
      us to document them, and the Internet, which enables us to publish this
      evidence.<br>
      <br>
      After <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6UzGIxQ_Qg"> the video of
        Officer Slager gunning down Walter Scott as he was running away</a>
      surfaced, Adam Johnson of Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Media wrote, <a href="//fair.org/blog-entries/media-were-already-running-with-police-fantasy-when-video-exploded-it/">"most
        of the local press," by simply repeating what police said, "amplified a
        storyline that, in retrospect, was entirely made up."</a> Even NBC News
      published a <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=klJjmFQf3dA"> mock
        report based on "official sources,"</a> observing that these were the
      only known sources before the video came out.<br>
      <br>
      The police department in Baltimore has been quick to tweet about <a href="//twitter.com/BaltimorePolice/status/592782221829898240">
        "violence,"</a> <a href="//twitter.com/BaltimorePolice/status/592833906392604673">
        "looting,"</a> and <a href="//twitter.com/BaltimorePolice/status/592772509059174400">
        "bottles and bricks being thrown at officers;"</a> a local teacher <a href="//twitter.com/SarahPinsker/status/592845471145689089">tweeted
        her experience</a> ("police were forcing busses to stop and unload all
      their passengers," students "were trying to leave on various busses but
      couldn't," cops "in full riot gear marching toward any small social clique
      of students." <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmWuCx_VII">This

      <span class="subtitle"> OGC Statement For Martin Luther King Day 2015:</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="title">The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther
        King, Jr. Was Murdered
        By the State</span><br>
      <br>
      Every year on Martin Luther King day we hear the same thing: “I have a
      dream....” It's a beautiful speech, a moving speech, a speech that
      reminds us how much we want human solidarity that's bigger and deeper
      than our shades of skin. But the Rev. Dr. King's vision and activism
      were bigger and deeper than racial harmony, and there's a lot more to
      his legacy – and his assassination – than the ruling class and their
      bought-and-paid-for media want us to know.<br>
      <br>
      We all know the official story that James Earl Ray shot the Rev. Dr.
      King. But a 1999 civil trial verdict in Memphis found that agents of
      the City of Memphis, the State of Tennessee, and the U.S. Government
      conspired to assassinate him, contracting with the New Orleans Mafia to
      do the hit (a Military Intelligence shooter team was also there as a
      backup, but left without firing a shot). William F. Pepper, a lawyer
      who worked with King and brought the lawsuit on behalf of the King
      family, worked for over twenty-five years building the case. He
      collected sworn testimony from Special Forces soldiers who were there
      as well as from the man who hid the actual murder weapon, other
      witnesses, and the report of the House Select Committee on
      Assassinations.<br>
      <br>
      King did not call for racial equality alone. He opposed the Vietnam
      war, calling the U.S. Government “the greatest purveyor of violence on
      earth.” He was organizing a national Poor Peoples' Campaign including a
      tent city of 500,000 in the shadow of the Washington Memorial. He
      called for a general strike in Memphis in solidarity with the
      sanitation workers. He even planned to run for President on an
      anti-war, anti-capitalist platform. Others were organizing for these
      ends as well. The ruling class was alarmed, and ramped up its
      surveillance and infiltration: the army put over 1500 plainclothes
      agents in “dissenting” organizations of all kinds, with King's
      Southern
      Christian Leadership Conference a high priority. The 902nd Military
      Intelligence Group began planning assassinations of key black leaders
      in 1963. Military Intelligence had been spying on King's family for
      three generations, and tasked three intelligence groups to infiltrate
      the Poor Peoples' Campaign. Big oilmen like Lyndon Johnson, H. L. Hunt,
      and Clint Murchison, along with their bankers and lawyers, would lose a
      lot of money if the war ended. Hunt and J. Edgar Hoover plotted to
      neutralize King's influence, with Hoover saying they must “completely
      silence” him. The intelligence agencies had a long-standing
      relationship with the Mafia, selling them guns stolen from National
      Guard armories for resale in Latin America, splitting the profits to
      fund covert operations.<br>
      <br>
      One witness actually had King in his crosshairs at a march In Memphis,
      but King abruptly turned, spoiling the shot. The government had offered
      a contract to one Mafia family, but never struck a deal. Finally a
      Memphis man connected with Carlos Marcello's New Orleans Mafia took the
      contract and arranged the hit.<br>
      <br>
      To avoid a trial, the government framed James Earl Ray and bullied him
      into taking a plea bargain. But Ray denied having shot King, and other
      witnesses corroborate this.<br>
      <br>
      We honor the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King not only as a great civil
      rights leader, but as a martyr for civil rights, workers, and
      peace-loving people everywhere, murdered by the covert capitalist state.<br>
